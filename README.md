The work done in this project is related to the work done in the paper "Remodelling State-Space Prediction with Deep Neural Networks for Probabilistic Load Forecasting".
SN_main.py file is the main file to be complied and stats.py file is the file containing statistical model (ISSM) which is integrated with RNN model.
Training.py and prediction.py files contain the training and prediction networks and Evaluator.py contains the evaluation settings.
Two different datasets file "ISO-NE with temp " file consists of multivariate data of 8 zones (both load and temperature) and GEFCom 2014 data consists of single zone load and temperature data.
