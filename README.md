# StateNeuron
The work done in this project is related to the work done in the paper "Remodelling State-Space Prediction with Deep Neural Networks for Probabilistic Load Forecasting".
Two different datasets file "ISO-NE with temp " file consists of multivariate data of 8 zones (both load and temperature) and GEFCom 2014 data consists of single zone load and temperature data.
The code files are under progress for developing into a python package ,so that it can be easily accessed by all and will be uploaded soon.
