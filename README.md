# StateNeuron
The work done in this project is related to the work done in the paper "Remodelling State-Space Prediction with Deep Neural Networks for Probabilistic Load Forecasting".
SN_main.py file is the main file to be complied and stats.py file is the file containing statical model (ISSM) which is integrated with RNN model.
Training.py and prediction.py files are for evaluating the training and prediction networks.
